            <h2>What is Interaction Design?</h2>
        </div>

        <p>“Interaction Design (IxD) defines the structure and behavior of interactive systems.Interaction Designers
            strive to create meaningful relationships between people and the products and services that they use, from
            computers to mobile devices to appliances and beyond. Our practices evolve with the world” — IXDA</p>

        <div id="defID">
            <h2>Every design starts with the research</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Browse: What is available on the internet about it, who is doing what or where is the market going.<br>
            Observe: Are you trying to improve the coffee shop experience? Then visit that cafe. <br>Talk to people: You
            will gather insights which you have never expected before. The ‘aha’ moments. Keep the questions open ended.

            <h2>Think in systems</h2>
        </div>

        <p>While paying attention to details, do remember to look at the bigger picture as well. Sometimes when we
            digging deeper into the details, we overlook how it affects other elements in our system.</p>

            <h2>Usertest</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Once it is on the paper, it is ready! And testing should happen throughout the design process. Create a flow
            — show it to the people, draw some sketches — show it to the people, create wireframes — show it to the
            people… At every step, take their authentic feedback. You will be learning a lot from them. “People” can be
            users, other designers, engineers, other stakeholders etc.</p>

            <h2>Collaboration is the key</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Collaboration is another form of interaction design where the interaction is between human to human.</p>
